Note: If the code is being tested from the intructor's side for generating the confusion matrix and for evaluation of the code using 5 objects, use the database file: object_db_task6.txt. For the rest of the recognition use: object_db_task9.txt. And also specify the new path of these files in operations.cpp in saveFeatureVector() and loadObjectDatabase().
